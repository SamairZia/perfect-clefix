              <h4 class="sbd-heading">3 TIPS FOR FINDING THE PERFECT CLEANING COMPANY FOR OFFICE FLOOR CLEANING SERVICES </h4>
              <p class="sbd-desc">Flooring in offices typically receives high levels of traffic that over time build up grease, dirt, dust, and grime in the fibers of the carpet and the grain of hard floors. Finding a cleaning company in Dubai that can deliver the level of service and results that you require may seem an impossible task when you first search Google for terms like Cleaners in Dubai. Consider these three tips and find the right cleaning company for your business.</p>

              <p class="sbd-desc">1. What experience does the cleaning company have? Many cleaning companies claim to have years of experience, yet a closer inspection often identifies a narrow application of skills. Find a cleaning company that has a wide range of experience in delivering contract cleaning and office cleaning services. Finding a cleaning company in Dubai with the right experience will mean that they will be able to lend advice and guidance in the type of cleaning required and the appropriate frequency with which the cleaning should be carried out.</p>
              <p class="sbd-desc">2. What type of training do their operatives receive? When we combine experience and the right training, we develop cleaning teams who can quickly identify the right cleaning techniques to employ and the machinery and cleaning materials required. If you are looking for steam cleaning of carpets, ask about the machinery that will be used. What type of chemicals are used in the process and what impact will the machinery have on the carpet fibers. When looking for hard floor cleaning in Dubai, focus questions around the experience of the operatives in delivering this service. Untrained or inexperienced hard floor cleaners can leave a surface scuffed or damaged.</p>
              <p class="sbd-desc">3. What level of Quality Assurance does the cleaning company offer? One-man bands may offer competitive rates, but the backup and support required to complete demanding cleaning schedules may be absent. Look for carpet cleaners in Dubai with Proper Certification and Good Reviews. Proper Certification and Good Reviews are gained by companies who can demonstrate clear planning that supports the delivery of services and ensures contingency planning is in place. Keeping your office flooring in great condition will ensure that your hard floors and carpets last longer, look great and ensure a healthy environment for staff and visitors. Perfect Clefix Cleaning and Technical Services have been delivering hard floor cleaning and carpet cleaning in Dubai for over Many years.</p>
